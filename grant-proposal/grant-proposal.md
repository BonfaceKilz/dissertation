# Introduction

In Africa, many people limit Data Science and it's many derivatives to the area of machine learning algorithms. This dissertation seeks to research how existing platforms, particularly huge data-sets around open-source bio-informatics data could be stored in a more efficient ways, and to demonstrate that in genenetwork.

The two aims of this dissertation are:

\begin{description}

\item[Aim 1: Improve the quality of data in GeneNetwork]

{
As data grows and evolves over time, the underlying database structure becomes more complicated. This complicated structure becomes an impediment to performing Machine Learning tasks. This dissertation will attempt to demonstrate the migration of a bio-informatics database to a more efficient graph-like database.
}

\item[Aim 2: Demonstrate Reproducibility in a data science project]

{
In Africa, as in the rest of the world, reproducibility in research is a problem. This dissertation aims at demonstrating how GNU Guix can be leveraged in guaranteeing reproducibility with regards to the software tool chain
