the content exported anyway.

** Issues:
- Data Quality
  
- Issues around sharing data. Here in Kenya, there's a law that says
  that all data related to health should be stored locally. The
  challenge with that is that we have very complicated schemas for
  said data. As an example, last time I checked, the Ministry of
  Health relies on <https://dhis2.org/> to collect, store, and release
  public data. I'd wager that many people struggle with evolving
  data-sets.

- Racial bias and unfair predictions.

- Reproducibility is one of them. I've heard no one talk about that. I
  hear no one talking about it. At SU, many people, with the exception
  of Shelby, do not appreciate it's significant. And people who may
  (in Corporations), interpret reproducibility as using Docker
  containers.
  
** Requirements [/]

- [ ] A research hypothesis and expected outcomes;
- [ ] A brief paragraph on the long-term vision for the work and a
  description of the intended deliverables;

- [ ] A realistic timeline of the research project;
- [ ] A budget detailing the total amount requested and expenditure allocation;
- [ ] A letter of support by their supervisor, and a copy of the MSc/PhD study admission letter;
- [ ] Current academic transcript of the applicant in the enrolled program;
- [ ] Proof of permanent residency or nationality of an eligible
  African country.

* Introduction

In Africa, many people limit Data Science and it's many derivatives to
the area of machine learning algorithms. This dissertation seeks to
research how existing platforms, particularly huge data-sets around
open-source bio-informatics data could be stored in a more efficient
ways, and to demonstrate that in genenetwork.


The two aims of this dissertation are:

\begin{description}

\item[Aim 1: Improve the quality of data in GeneNetwork]

{
As data grows and evolves over time, the underlying database structure becomes more complicated. This complicated structure becomes an impediment to performing Machine Learning tasks. This dissertation will attempt to demonstrate the migration of a bio-informatics database to a more efficient graph-like database.
}

\item[Aim 2: Demonstrate Reproducibility in a data science project]

{
In Africa, as in the rest of the world, reproducibility in research is a problem. This dissertation aims at demonstrating how GNU Guix can be leveraged in guaranteeing reproducibility with regards to the software tool chain
}
