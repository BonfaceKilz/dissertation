This dissertation improved the accessibility and interpretability of biological data stored in the GeneNetwork (GN) repository for machine analysis.  The GN database contains over 20 years of experimental data from genetics, phenotyping, QTL and GWA studies in human and model species, such as mouse and rat.  However, the data is currently difficult to access and manipulate due to its complex underlying structures, including around 80 cross-referenced SQL tables and various file types.  To address these challenges, the data was re-organised into RDF to provide automated data discovery using graph database technology.  This will enable the creation of a new, more flexible GN service and the ability to automatically infer relationships between data elements.  Overall, the value of the GN service was enhanced through improved data retrieval, enabling complex query capabilities and facilitating the exploration of future storage and retrieval techniques that are relevant for AI research on biomedical data.
