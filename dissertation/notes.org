In RDF, what does reification mean?

In the Resource Description Framework (RDF), reification refers to the process of making a statement about a statement, or describing a statement using the RDF model. This is typically done by creating a new resource that represents the original statement, and then describing that resource using other RDF triples. This allows for statements to be treated as first-class citizens in the RDF graph, which can be useful for certain applications, such as tracking provenance information or expressing metadata about a statement.

Species -> Group -> Type (Expression Profiles; Genotypes; Phenotypes) -> Dataset

Record ID gives a unique identifier for each data set, (e.g. a number for phenotype data sets and a probe set identifier for expression data sets),

Calculate Correlations is used to compute the bivariate correlations between the reference trait and any other set of traits that has been measured in the same Group.
